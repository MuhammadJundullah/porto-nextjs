              I am a 6th-semester Informatics Engineering student with an
              interest in web development and data-related fields. I have
              experience in web development, as well as skills in dashboard
              creation and data prediction. I am open to remote freelance
              projects and ready to join a team to work while continuously
              learning together.

            I specialize in creating responsive websites and data-driven
            applications using modern technologies. From backend development
            using Laravel and PostgreSQL, to analyzing data pipelines with tools
            like Apache Airflow and Kafka â€” I aim to combine clean code with
            impactful functionality. As someone who grew up around the hard work
            of a coffee-farming family, I bring the same dedication and
            attention to detail into every project I work on. I love
            transforming complex data into useful insights and building web apps
            that are not just functional, but also meaningful.
